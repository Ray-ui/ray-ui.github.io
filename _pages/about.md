# &#128512; About me
My research focuses on WiFi localization, using deep learning to tackle indoor positioning challenges.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->


# 🔥 News
- <span class='label label-update'>Dec 2024</span>:
This year, I've dedicated significant time to exploring a new platform, addressing a variety of engineering challenges 😓.
The exciting news, however, is that a paper based on this platform has just been submitted to TMC—stay tuned for more updates! 🎉
- <span class='label label-update'>Oct 2024</span>:
I’m very happy to have met everyone in Melbourne. Looking forward to our next meeting!
