[Indoor Localization] [Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)] [ Data-driven ] [Large-scale Deployment]

This series explores data-driven localization approaches on a large-scale ISAC platform.

<span class='label label-conf'>Submit to IOTJ</span>: [Lessons from Deploying Learning-based CSI Localization on a Large-Scale ISAC Platform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17173)

This work presents some interesting challenges we encountered while deploying a learning-based localization system in a large-scale ISAC platform.

We look forward to sharing more upcoming results in this line of research. -->

# &#128187; Projects

- [Human-held device WiFi indoor localization dataset](https://github.com/H-WILD/human_held_device_wifi_indoor_localization_dataset): We have developed the H-WILD dataset for WiFi-based indoor localization using human-held devices. Special thanks to my collaborator, Guanzhong Wang. I welcome potential collaborations to enhance the value of this project for the community.

- [Waypoint-based Fingerprint Collection Tools](/docs/image-20240820143646502.png "Waypoint-based Fingerprint Collection Workflow"): Inspired by the [Kaggle Indoor Location & Navigation competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions/indoor-location-navigation), I developed a fingerprint collection framework that utilizes landmarks and pedestrian trajectory tracking to support large-scale deployments. The codebase is currently for internal use only, as the mapping system is specifically tailored to our deployment scenarios. Special thanks to Jinran Sun, Yuhong Sun, Xinxin Li, Lu Yi, and Jiamu Li for their contributions to the data collection efforts.
